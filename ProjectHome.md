Google Code is closing and the PAGAN homepage has been moved onto a new server.

The new address of the PAGAN homepage is  **[http://wasabiapp.org/software/pagan](http://wasabiapp.org/software/pagan)**. That page contains instructions for the installation and use of PAGAN and links to the latest versions of binary packages.


The latest source code can be obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/ariloytynoja/pagan-msa). Comments and bug reports can be entered through [the Issues page](https://github.com/ariloytynoja/pagan-msa/issues).

PAGAN is under development. If you have questions or suggestions how to improve the method, please contact the author.
